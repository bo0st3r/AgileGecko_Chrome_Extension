# AgileGecko

## Install the extension 
### Requirements
* A Chromium based browser (Chrome, Brave, Opera, ...) 

### Steps
As it is not yet available on the Chrome Web Store, you have to load it as an "unpacked extension".
* Clone the repository
* Run `ng build --prod` to build as a production version
* Go to the "Extensions" tab of your browser
* Enable the "Developer mode"
* Click "Load unpacked extension" and select the project's `dist` folder

In case this didn't work, check that the "manifest.json" file exists in the `dist/AgileGecko` folder.
